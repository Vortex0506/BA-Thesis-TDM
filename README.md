# BA-Thesis-TDM
This repository contains the codebase for my bachelor thesis project. 

The report contains everything one needs to know about what work has been done.

To run the web application: download the repo and follow the README in "DCR-Graph-App-main".

The thesis was the first step of a proof of concept. The business process modelling application (DCR) was extended with a test system.
This test system enables test-driven modelling. In the TDM approach, a model capturing a workflow/business process should live up to the constraints and rules defined beforehand. 
When the model evolves the constraints are evaluated in order to ensure the correctness of the model.
